the game is windows only and should work by just running the game.exe file in 
3dgamecw(with .exe)/AGT_TEMPLATE/bin/Debug-windows-x86_64/game/game.exe

if that doesnt work then move the assets folder from the above directory and put it in
3dgamecw(with .exe)/AGT_TEMPLATE/game/

then open the engine.sln file in visual studio 2019 and run the game 
3dgamecw(with .exe)/AGT_TEMPLATE/engine.sln
